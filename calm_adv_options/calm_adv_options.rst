Overview
++++++++

Nutanix Calm allows you to seamlessly select, provision, and manage your business applications across your infrastructure for both the private and public clouds. Nutanix Calm provides App lifecycle, monitoring and remediation to manage your heterogeneous infrastructure, for example, VMs or bare-metal servers. Nutanix Calm supports multiple platforms so that you can use a single self-service and automation interface to manage all your infrastructure.

Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) is defined as the ability to quickly provide compute resources, on-demand through a self service portal.  While many customers utilize Nutanix Calm to orchestrate complex, multi-tiered applications, a significant portion of customers also utilize Calm to provide basic IaaS for their end users.

**In this lab you'll create a "Single VM Blueprint" based on Linux, launch the blueprint, and manage the resulting application.**
